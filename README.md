<h1>AWS - Objectives</h1>

-Analyze the difference between a statically and dynamically assigned IP addresses using EC2 instances

-Assign a persistent (static) IP to an EC2 instance

-Develop a solution to the customers issue found within this lab; after developing a solution, summarize and describe your findings

<br />

<h2>Ticket from the customer</h2>

Hello, Cloud Support!

We are having issues with one of our EC2 instances. The IP changes every time we start and stop this instance called Public Instance. This causes everything to break since it needs a static IP address. We are not sure why the IP changes on this instance to a random IP every time. Can you please investigate? Attached is our architecture. Please let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks!

Bob

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

Task 1: Investigate the customer's environment

Task 2: Send the Response to the customer
  

<h2>Task Steps</h2>

<p>
1. Start by opening the AWS Management Console.
</p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
4. Copy and paste the names and IP addresses of both instances for future reference in a text editor. Select the check box next to instance A. At the bottom of the page, choose the Networking tab, and note the Public and Private IPv4 addresses. Once you copy and paste the name and IP addresses, deselect the instance, and then select instance B and do the same

<h2>Task 2 Steps</h2>

<p>
1. Download PEM file and save the labsuser.pem file

</p>
<br />

<p>
2. Open a terminal window, and change directory cd to the directory where the labsuser.pem file was downloaded. For example, if the labuser.pem file was saved to your Downloads directory, run this command: cd ~/Downloads <img src=https://i.imgur.com/xbtTCBI.png/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
3. Change the permissions on the key to be read-only, by running this command: chmod 400 labsuser-7.pem <img src=https://i.imgur.com/T5v67gr.png/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
4. Run the command: ssh -i labsuser-7.pem ec2-user@10.0.10.102. We were not able to connect to instance A. <img src=https://i.imgur.com/gjyhCl7.png/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
5.Run the command: ssh -i labsuser-7.pem ec2-user@35.91.189.114. We were able to connect to instance B using the public IP address. <img src=https://i.imgur.com/zuK7VZ4.png/>
</p>
<br />

<h2>Recap</h2>

<p>
In this lab you have investigated the customer's environment and applied troubleshooting techniques that allowed you to resolve the customersâ€™ issue. Within the scenario, you discovered that the customer's EC2 instance (instance A) needed a public IP address to connect to the internet. This was tested by using an SSH utility to connect to the instance. Private IP addresses are used within the VPC and cannot establish a connection to the internet
